                    <p>Flutes are traverse blown woodwind instruments made out of silver and sometimes other metals. Sophie’s flutes are the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Flute (Arista)</li>
                        <li>Alto Flute (Yamaha)</li>
                        <li>Piccolo (Pearl)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The flute (sometimes called the concert flute) is the main instrument in the family and is the most commonly played. It has a three octave range starting from middle C. The alto flute extends a fourth lower and is most at home in its strong, velvety and rich first register. The piccolo sounds an octave above the concert flute and has a clear, piercing sound. It is most commonly heard in its shrill second and third registers.</p>

                <div class="instrument-info">
                    <p>Clarinets are reed instruments with a wooden body and metal keys. Sophie’s clarinets are the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bb/A clarinets (Peter Eaton)</li>
                        <li>Bass clarinet (Buffet Tosca)</li>
                        <li>Eb clarinet (Buffet RC)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Bb clarinet is the most commonly heard member of this family. It’s slightly longer and darker counterpart is the A clarinet. Sounding just a semitone below the Bb, it is rarely used outside a classical orchestral setting. The bass clarinet sounds an octave below the Bb clarinet and is a versatile instrument which can be played across nearly four and a half octaves, although the first two are the most widely used. The Eb clarinet sounds a fourth above its Bb counterpart and has a piercing, brash sound that stands out most in its higher reaches.</p>

                <div class="instrument-info">
                    <p>Recorders are fipple blown instruments made out of wood. Sophie’s recorders are the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Soprano (Takeyama)</li>
                        <li>Alto (Ralf Ehlert)</li>
                        <li>Tenor (Kung)</li>
                        <li>Basses in G, F and C, tenor in D (Adriana Breukink)</li>
                        <li>Ganassi soprano and g-alto (Bodil Diesen)</li>
                        <li>Baroque pitch altos in F and G (Joachim Rohmer)</li>
                        <li>Tenor in D (Joachim Rohmer)</li>
                        <li>Tenor in Db (Luca de Paolis)</li>
                        <li>Sopranino (Kung)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Recorders are highly versatile instruments and are just as comfortable playing silky smooth soulful melodies as they are with lightning fast flurries of notes. Capable of delivering across a wide range dynamic range, recorders always sound best when played in tune. Each recorder has a range of two octaves and can be played chromatically, although they are most comfortable in keys up to 4 flats or 4 sharps. If a difficult key is needed, then the player need only use a different pitch recorder to get the desired result. Having recorders from C-bass to soprano gives Sophie a combined four and a half octave range across her recorder collection.</p>

                    <p>The term “world flutes” covers a vast range of instruments used in different types of folk music across the world. Sophie plays the following types of world flutes:</p>
                    <table>

                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Sáo Trúc</td>
                            <td>Vietnamese chromatic bamboo flutes</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Panflutes</td>
                            <td>Sometimes called “Nai”, used in Romanian traditional music</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                </div>
                <p class="temporary-wf-p">The fact that many of these instruments are made of a single bamboo tube with large open holes gives the player lots of freedom to shape and bend notes and as a result, it can feel very like the human voice when playing. It also means that the flutes are most comfortable in their home key and its modes. For this reason, it is necessary to have each type of instrument in several different pitches to be able to play in all keys. Chromaticism isn’t usually practical; however, the Vietnamese Sáo Trúc have an innovative solution to this: instead of the usual six finger holes, they have ten, opening up possibilities for a full chromatic scale.</p>

                <div class="instrument-info">
                    <p>Saxophones are reed instruments usually made out of brass. Sophie’s saxophones are the following:</p>

                        <li>Soprano saxophone (Yanigasawa)</li>

                    <p>The alto and tenor are probably the most commonly heard, although all four are widely used as part of sax sections in shows or big bands. The alto and baritone are in Eb, sounding an octave apart and the soprano and tenor are in Bb, also sounding an octave apart. They can be found in most styles of music from the beginning of the twentieth century until the present day and are especially effective when played in a section.</p>
